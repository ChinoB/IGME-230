## Gameplay
### Mechanics
If you strike your weapon where the enemy just barely is in range, the attack does much more damage.
The player will always be faster than enemies to ensure if this fails, they can still retreat and try again or just attack.

***Secret***
If the player holds the right mouse for 5 seconds while an enemy is on the screen, the player will attack frequently for 4 seconds.
However, this can only be used once per 30 seconds.

**The player will be hinted about this secret with a riddle.**

### Controls
Arrow keys to move
Space to jump
Left click to attack

*The player will learn the controls before starting the game*

### Depth
Throughout the game, the player is expected to get used to timing their attacks correctly, 
as the enemies start to spawn faster and well timed attacks do more damage.
**A well timed attack will be shown after the 1st 10 enemies have been killed*
